# Python: Unsupervised Learning

Teaching materials for STFC summer school (25/07/2018) and ASI Data Science Fellowship. 

The course introduces unsupervised learning, focussing on the two main facets of this area namely clustering and dimensionality reduction. Both elementary methods such as k-means and PCA are covering before moving onto more advanced topics such as DBSCAN and t-SNE. Only the notebooks are included in this repository. Email me directly if you would like access to the lecture slides.
